This is a collection of Pi-Hole Blocklists for different sets of domains. It's broken out into specific files to block specific websites / services. There is also a `*-all.txt` blocklist that combines all sub-blocklists into a single blocklist that can be used.

Please feel free to use the following blocklists you feel will help you block the specific websites / services you wish to block using your Pi-Hole instance.

Enjoy!
